Workspace & WindowMaker interoperation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> Start order:
  + Workspace starts and set display attributes (resolution, desktop 
    background, etc.);
  + WindowMaker initializes and shows dock (no autolaunch or other activity);
  - Workspace start applications with 'AutoLaunch' attribute set in WMState;
  - Workspace cathes launching of app with GNUstep notifications;
  - WindowMaker tells to Workspace about running non-GNUstep applications;
  - Workspace adds running app into 'Processes' panel;
  - Start ends.

> Stop order:
  - Workspace terminate running GNUstep apps;
  - Workspace tells WindowMaker to terminte running non-GNUstep apps;
  - if apps quit Workspace initializes logout process;
  - if user selects 'Power Off' button Workspace tells to Login about power-off
    sequence.
  - Workspace application terminate running.

> Applications management
  < Applications can of 2 types: GNUstep and X11. 
    Workspace manages GNUstep apps - WindowMaker non-GNUstep. 
    Windows of both types of apps are managed by WindowMaker >

  = WindowMaker effects on app start/end:
    > catch app through Map/Unmap events
    > if WindowMaker initiates launch: draws lauching state of icon
    > draw icon of running app
  = Workspace effects on app start/end:
    > catch app from: GNUstep notification, WindowMaker message;
    > adds running app to Processes panel;
    > removes finished app from Processes panel;
    > if Workspace initiates laucnh: slide appicon from 'File Viewer' to
      dock/bottom of screen;

  = Applications start:
    > GNUstep started with:
      > WindowMaker Dock:
	> WindowMaker updates state of docked appicon;
	> WindowMaker draws appicon on app winow Map event;
	> Workspace catch its launching through GNUstep notifications;
      > Workspace:
	> WindowMaker updates/creates docked/undocked appicon;
	> [TODO] Workspace asks to WindowMaker about appicon position;
	> [TODO] Workspace slide appicon to dock/bottom of screen;
	> Workspace catch its launching through GNUstep notifications;
      > CLI:
	> WindowMaker updates/creates docked/undocked appicon;
	> Workspace catch its launching through GNUstep notifications;
    > X11 (GTK, QT etc.) started with:
      > WindowMaker Dock:
	> WindowMaker updates/creates appicon with state 
	  (in dock or bottom of screen);
	> [TODO] WindowMaker tells to Workspace when launching starts and ends;
	> [TODO] Workspace adds app to 'Processes' panel;
      > Workspace:
	> WindowMaker updates/creates docked/undocked appicon;
	> [TODO] WindowMaker tells to Workspace when launching starts and ends;
	> [TODO] Workspace adds app to 'Processes' panel;
      > CLI:
	> same as with Workspace

  = Applications exit:
    > GNUstep:
      > Workspace catch its exiting through GNUstep notifications;
      > Workspace removes app from 'Processes' panel;
      > WindowMaker get Unmap/Destroy event;
      > WindowMaker updates/removes docked/undocked appicon;
    > X11 (GTK, QT etc.):
      > WindowMaker get Unmap/Destroy event;
      > WindowMaker updates/removes docked/undocked appicon;
      > [TODO] WindowMaker tells to Workspace about app exit;
      > [TODO] Workspace removes app from 'Processes' panel;
	

> Dock & icons (miniwindows, appicons, docked appicons)

WindowMaker machinery:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- essential files: appicon.c, application.c, event.c, window.c

- Every managed application consists of:
  + WAppicon (appicon.c, appicon.h):
    (char *)command
    (Window)main_window
    (WDock *)dock
    (char *)wm_class
    (char *)wm_instace

  + WApplication: (Window)main_window, (WAppIcon *)app_icon,
    (WWindow *)main_window_desc, (WMenu *)menu
