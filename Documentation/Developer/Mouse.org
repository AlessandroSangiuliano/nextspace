* Mouse cursors
There are several ways to set mouse cursor:
1. Directly call to Xcursor's Xorg extension functions. Cursor names defined in
   /usr/include/X11/cursorfont.h and start with "XC_" prefix.
2. Using NSCursor class methods that returns standard cursors.
3. Using NSCursor and providing image to it.

Method 1 is used by X11 applications like WindowMaker to set cursor image for
specific operation.
Method 2 used by AppKit applications that doesn't have its own cursors and want to
use standard ones.
Method 3 used by AppKit applications that have its own cursors and want to set
cursors for specific actions.

In general, X11 and Xcursor extension have no rules for using mouse cursors.
This document was written to define those rules for NEXTSPACE applications.

For X11 cursor names I use Adwaita cursor theme which is the "de facto" standard.

** Resize cursors
resize*Cursor: - T-shaped cursor with arrow. These types of cursor are
designed to use inside applications (resizing NSSplitView, resizing columns in
NSTableView etc.).

These cursors has names prefixed with "sb_" (sb_down_arrow, sb_up_arrow,
sb_right_arrow, sb_left_arrow, sb_h_double_arrow, sb_v_double_arrow) inside
Xorg themes directory.

Workspace use it's own resizing cursors. These cursors are plain-shaped arrows
(without perpendicular lines to arrow plane).

** Drag and Drop
Move operation cursor - green arrow. Recoloured version of arrow cursor
(arrowCursor:). This cursor is set by AppKit on move drag and drop operation.
Adwaita theme name: "dnd-move".
Copy operarion cursor - dragCopyCursor: method. Adwaita theme: "dnd-copy". 
Link operation cursor - dragLinkCursor: method. Adwaita theme: "dnd-link".

Workspace use the same images as AppKit does.

** Grabbing
Some applications need to use some sort of drag and drop: grabbing. It is not
drag and drop by nature (e.g. dragging document or image to scroll visible
rectangle).
Application should indicate possibility of such operation by "open hand"
cursor (openHandCursor: NSCursor's method, no analog in Xorg) while mouse is
over part of application window that can be grabbed. Clicking and holding mouse
button action must change cursor image to "closed hand" (closedHandCursor:
method, "fleur" cursor in Xorg).

Workspace use it's own grabbing cursor: four-side arrows image. Used for
dragging windows.

** Contextual menu cursor
Used only inside applications.
AppKit: contextualMenuCursor:.
Adwaita: context-menu.
Every view that has special context menu (called by right-clicking on it:
replaced application menu) should change cursor image on mouse enter.
