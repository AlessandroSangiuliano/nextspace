# NEXTSPACE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEXTSPACE is desktop environment that brings NeXTSTEP look and feel to Linux. I try to keep as close as possible user experience to original NeXT's OS.

## What NEXTSPACE is
  * desktop environment;
  * includes core applications (Login, Workspace, Preferences, Terminal);
  * tightly integrated with CentOS Linux and uses modern technologies like:
      * UDisks2 - media and volume management;
      * X.org - window management, peripherals configuration (kerboard, mouse, displays);
      * GNUstep libraries
      * Grand Central Dispatch
  * 

## What NEXTSPACE is not aimed to be
  * X11 window manager only (it includes WindowMaker though);
  * GNOME, KDE rival in terms of visual effects (window drop shadows, )
  
## My goals
  * create desktop environment with functionality that modern desktops provide (KDE, GNOME, XFCE);
  * 

As opposite to other projects this is not just look (icons, titlebars, menus) but also complete user set actions to make their tasks done. NEXSTPACE designed to propose to the user functinality that modern desktops do (GNOME, KDE).
